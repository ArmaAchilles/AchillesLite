## Introduction
**Ares Mod - Achilles Expansion**, better known as _Achilles_, is a gameplay modification for Arma 3. It expands the Zeus real-time editor with many new additions as well as provides bug fixes.
Check [_Achilles_](https://github.com/ArmaAchilles/AresModAchillesExpansion) for more information.

**Achillite** is a lite version of _Achilles_ packed in a single script to be run with an admin console. Hence, no add-on is needed at all. Note that it only provides a few selected modules from _Achilles_.
